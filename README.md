####  Variables: 
- npmPackageName: Name of package in npm registry
- slug: GitHub slug associated with package 
- isAbandoned: binary flag representing whether we identified the package as abandoned during our observation window
- repoArchived: binary flag representing whether we identified the package's repository as being archived during our observation window
- READMEKeyword: binary flag representing whether we identified the package's repository README as containing an abandonment announcement during our observation window
- READMEBadge: binary flag repreenting whether we identified the package's repository README as containing the `no maintenance intended`  badge during our observation window

- monthsFromAbandonmentToRemoval - Elapsed time from abandonment to removal in months 
- abandonmentTypeBinary - Binary flag for the type of dependency abandonment ('explicit-notice','activity-based'), note if dependency met both abandonment definitions we considered it explicit-notice

- numStarsCurrent - Number of stars for the package (as of September 2023)
- numIssuesOpened - Number of issues opened in year before abandonment
- numIssuesClosed - Number of issues closed in year before abandonment



### UpdateExposedDependentsData.csv
Dataset containing the 11,925 dependent projects identified in RQ2b, note this dataset includes the subset of dependents who used floating declarations to automatically update which we exclude from our primary analysis but include here for comparitive explorations (See Sec. V).
#### Variables: 
- repo - GitHub repo slug for dependent project
- dependency - Name of the npm package the project was identified as depending on 
- dependencyVOI - The dependency version of interest we observed the response to 
- dependencyVOIDateTime - The date when the dependencyVOI was released
- updateLagHrs - The lag in time to update in hours (value of -1 if they did not update during our observation window)
- updateLagMonths The lag in time to update in months (value of -1 if they did not update during our observation window)
- depRemoved - Commit sha of commit used to remove dependency (if they did so during our observation window)
- versionRemovedDateTime - Date when commit removing dependency was made (if they do so during our observation window)
- baselineVersionFloating - Binary flag representing whether they were identified as using a floating declaration for the dependency at the time of dependencyVOI release
- latestCommit - The month of the latest recorded commit in the repo (as of September 2023)




### vulnerabilityExposedDependentsData.csv
